### Documentation:

In this diagram on DDOS attacks:

- The **attacker** starts the attack by controlling the botnet.
- The **botnet** then overwhelms the web server by sending massive amounts of traffic to the server.
- The **web server** requests a traffic analysis from the firewall to help manage the load that the botnet is sending.
- The **firewall** inspects the traffic, identifies malicious traffic, and blocks the botnet's IPs to mitigate the attack.
